# Foundation-4-grid-psd

### A Photoshop guide for Foundation v4

**Set to max-width: 1030px (64.375em) and a column gutter of 30px (15px 0.9375em each side)** 

Understandably rapid prototyping in Foundation might eliminate the need for a PSD file like this, but since I designed this for a project of my own so I could play around with some specific designs, I thought I might as well share it.

##### Built using [http://guideguide.me/](http://guideguide.me/) for Photoshop
**Which is helpful and will make it easy to make your own.**

[Foundation Grid & Photoshop -What you need to know](http://www.zurb.com/article/1053/foundation-s-grid-and-photoshop-what-you-)

I set this up to work with the defaults that are already in place if using [Laravel-Foundation-v4](https://github.com/jordanboston/laravel-foundation-v4)

**This file is based on another file that is similar, but I cannot remember the author.  I recreated the PSD for Foundation 4.**
